    <h1>Beetles, Worms, and Roaches</h1>

    <p>You pull on your gloves, grab the feeding tray, and start with the beetle shelf.</p>

    <p>You give the <strong>Hercules beetle</strong>, the <strong>frog-leg beetles</strong>, and the
      <strong>blue death feigning beetles (BDFBs)</strong> some nice sweet fruit to snack on.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Eastern lubber grasshoppers</strong> get a fresh pile of lettuce and carrots,
      while the <strong>hornworms</strong> happily start chewing on new tomato plants.</p>

    <p>In the worm bins, you refresh the <strong>silkworms</strong> with crisp mulberry leaves.
      Finally, the <strong>domino roaches</strong> and <strong>cave roaches</strong> get a good
      mixed plate of leftovers and veggie scraps so nothing goes to waste.</p>

    <p>Everyone is eating, climbing, and exploring. The room is quiet except for tiny feet
      tapping on bark and plastic. It feels like the day is finally settling into motion.</p>
