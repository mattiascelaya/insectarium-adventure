    <h1>Butterfly Morning</h1>

    <p>You walk into the <strong>butterfly vivarium</strong>, and the warm, humid air
      wraps around you like a gentle blanket. A few butterflies are already gliding
      around, searching for food in the early morning light.</p>

    <p>You start by checking the <strong>chrysalises</strong>. Several new butterflies have
      emerged overnight, their wings still slightly crinkled. You gently transfer
      them into a cloth emergence box so they can finish drying safely.</p>

    <p>Next, you prepare the <strong>nectar dishes</strong>, refilling them with sugar water
      and replacing old fruit with fresh slices of orange, banana, and watermelon.
      As you clean up, butterflies begin to notice the food and land to investigate,
      uncoiling their proboscises to sip the sweet juice.</p>

    <p>You walk the perimeter, checking the plants for any dead butterflies. You water
      the plants and mist some of the leaves; almost immediately, more butterflies
      land and drink from the water droplets. Everything seems stable and calm.</p>

    <p>As you work, the room fills with soft, fluttering motion. It feels peaceful—
      like the whole space is moving in slow, colorful waves.</p>
