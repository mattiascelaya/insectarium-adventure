    <h1>Counting Phasmids</h1>

    <p>You slide open the tall phasmid enclosure and gently move the branches aside, 
       scanning for legs, antennae, and leafy silhouettes.</p>

    <p>First you count the <strong>golden-eyed stick insects</strong> one by one. 
       After a careful headcount, all <strong>13</strong> are present and clinging calmly to the branches.</p>

    <p>Next are the <strong>Annam stick insects</strong>. You double-check every twig and vine until 
       you find all <strong>10</strong>, lined up in their usual spots.</p>

    <p>The <strong>leaf insects</strong> are trickier. After searching really hard through layer after layer 
       of foliage, you finally spot all <strong>5</strong>, perfectly camouflaged and pretending to be leaves.</p>

    <p>You add in fresh leaves for everyone and check the <strong>orchid mantis</strong> in its enclosure. 
       It’s perched in its usual spot, colors bright, posture relaxed. Everything looks stable and healthy.</p>

    <p>The quiet patience of the phasmids makes the room feel calm and slow, like the air has softened around you.</p>
